## glab completion

Generate shell completion scripts

### Synopsis

Generate shell completion scripts for glab commands.
The output of this command will be computer code and is meant to be saved to a
file or immediately evaluated by an interactive shell.
For example, for bash you could add this to your '~/.bash_profile':
	eval "$(glab completion -s bash)"
When installing glab through a package manager, however, it's possible that
no additional shell configuration is necessary to gain completion support. For
Homebrew, see <https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion>


```
glab completion [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help           help for completion
  -s, --shell string   Shell type: {bash|zsh|fish|powershell}
```
